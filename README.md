-I would like to acknowledge the starter code for both PyBank and PyPoll were used.  Rather than fill in the starter
code, I reviewed as a guideline and wrote my own 'main.py' files 
-I would also like to acknowledge use of the Xpert Learning Assistant found on bootcampspot, this tool was able to find typos and syntax errors in my python code along the way, as well as give an explanation as to how to use a dictionary to store the results as a list
